            <header ><br>2.1 values and types</header>
            <p>
                A value is one of the basic things a program works with, like a letter or a number.
                The values we have seen so far are 1, 2, and “Hello, World!”
            </p>
            <p>
                These values belong to diﬀerent types: 2 is an integer, and “Hello, World!” is a
                string, so called because it contains a “string” of letters. You (and the interpreter)
                can identify strings because they are enclosed in quotation marks.
            </p>
            <p>
                The print statement also works for integers. We use the python command to start
                the interpreter.
            </p>
            <code>
                python<br>
                >>> print(4)<br>
                4
            </code>
            <p>
                If you are not sure what type a value has, the interpreter can tell you.
            </p>
            <code>
                >>> type('Hello, World!')<br>
                < class 'str'><br>
                >>> type(17)<br>
                < class 'int'><br>
            </code>
            <p>
                Not surprisingly, strings belong to the typestr and integers belong to the type
                int. Less obviously, numbers with a decimal point belong to a type calledfloat,
                because these numbers are represented in a format called ﬂoating point.
            </p>
            <code>
                >>> type(3.2)<br>
                < class 'float'>
            </code>

        <section class="main-section" id="2.2_variables">
            <header ><br><br>2.2 Variables</header>
            <p>
                One of the most powerful features of a programming language is the ability to
                manipulate variables. A variable is a name that refers to a value.
            </p>
            <p>
                An assignment statement creates new variables and gives them values:
            </p>
            <code>
                >>> message ='And now for something completely different'<br>
                >>> n=17<br>
                >>> pi=3.1415926535897931
            </code>
            <p>
                This example makes three assignments. The first assigns a string to a new variable
                named message; the second assigns the integer 17 ton; the third assigns the
                (approximate) value ofπ to pi.
            </p>
            <p>
                To display the value of a variable, you can use a print statement:
            </p>
            <code>
                >>> print(n)<br>
                17<br>
                >>> print(pi)<br>
                3.141592653589793
            </code>
            <p>
                The type of a variable is the type of the value it refers to.
            </p>
            <code>
                >>> type(message)<br>
                < class 'str'><br>
                >>> type(n)<br>
                < class 'int'><br>
                >>> type(pi)<br>
                < class 'float'>
            </code>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="2.3_variable_names_and_keywords">
            <header ><br><br>2.3 Variable names and keywords</header>
            <p>
                Programmers generally choose names for their variables that are meaningful and
                document what the variable is used for.
            </p>
            <p>
                Variable names can be arbitrarily long. They can contain both letters and numbers,
                but they cannot start with a number. It is legal to use uppercase letters, but it is
                a good idea to begin variable names with a lowercase letter (you’ll see why later).
            </p>
            <p>
                The underscore character(_) can appear in a name. It is often used in names with
                multiple words, such as my_name or air speed_of_unladen_swallow. Variable
                names can start with an underscore character, but we generally avoid doing this
                unless we are writing library code for others to use.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you give a variable an illegal name, you get a syntax error:
            </p>
            <code>
                >>> 76trombones = 'big parade'<br>
                SyntaxError: invalid syntax<br>
                >>> more@ =1000000<br>
                SyntaxError: invalid syntax<br>
                >>> class ='Advanced Theoretical Zymurgy'<br>
                SyntaxError: invalid syntax
            </code>
            <p>
                76trombones is illegal because it begins with a number. more@ is illegal because
                it contains an illegal character, @. But what’s wrong with class?
            </p>
            <p>
                It turns out that class is one of Python’s keywords. The interpreter uses keywords
                to recognize the structure of the program, and they cannot be used as variable
                names.
            </p>
            <p>
                Python has a total of 35 reserved keywords. some of pythons reserved keywords are:<br>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>and</li>
                <li>del</li>
                <li>from</li>
                <li>if</li>
                <li>else</li>
                <li>not</li>
                <li>while</li>
                <li>or</li>
                <li>return</li>
            </ul>

        <section class="main-section" id="2.4_statements">
            <header><br><br>2.4 Statements</header>
            <p>
                A statement is a unit of code that the Python interpreter can execute. We have
                seen two kinds of statements: print being an expression statement and assignment.
            </p>
            <p>
                When you type a statement in interactive mode, the interpreter executes it and
                displays the result, if there is one.
            </p>
            <p>
                A script usually contains a sequence of statements. If there is more than one
                statement, the results appear one at a time as the statements execute.
            </p>
            <p>
                For example, the script
            </p>
            <code>
                print(1)<br>
                x= 2<br>
                print(x)
            </code>
            <p>
                produces the output
            </p>
            <code>
                1<br>
                2
            </code>
            <p>
                The assignment statement produces no output.
            </p>

        <section class="main-section" id="2.5_operators_and_operands">
            <header ><br><br>2.5 Operators and operands </header>
            <p>
                Operators are special symbols that represent computations like addition and multiplication.
                The values the operator is applied to are called operands
            </p>
            <p>
                The operators+,-,*,/, and** perform addition, subtraction, multiplication,
                division, and exponentiation, as in the following examples:
            </p>
            <code>
                20+32<br>
                hour-1<br>
                hour*60+minute<br>
                minute/60<br>
                5**2<br>
                (5+9)*(15-7)
            </code>
            <p>
                There has been a change in the division operator between Python 2.x and Python
                3.x. In Python 3.x, the result of this division is a floating point result:
            </p>
            <code>
                >>> minute =59<br>
                >>> minute/60<br>
                0.9833333333333333
            </code>
            <p>
                The division operator in Python 2.0 would divide two integers and truncate the
                result to an integer:
            </p>
            <code>
                >>> minute =59<br>
                >>> minute/60<br>
                0
            </code>
            <p>
                To obtain the same answer in Python 3.0 use ﬂoored (// integer) division.
            </p>
            <code>
                >>> minute =59<br>
                >>> minute//60<br>
                0
            </code>
            <p>
                In Python 3.0 integer division functions much more as you would expect if you
                entered the expression on a calculator.

            <header ><br><br>2.6 Expressions</header>
            <p>
                An expression is a combination of values, variables, and operators. A value all by
                itself is considered an expression, and so is a variable, so the following are all legal
                expressions (assuming that the variable x has been assigned a value):
            </p>
            <code>
                17<br>
                x<br>
                x+ 17
            </code>
            <p>
                If you type an expression in interactive mode, the interpreter evaluates it and
                displays the result:
            </p>
            <code>
                >>> 1+1<br>
                2
            </code>
            <p>
                But in a script, an expression all by itself doesn’t do anything!This is a common
                source of confusion for beginners.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="2.7_order_of_operation">
            <header ><br><br>2.7 Order of operation</header>
            <p>
                When more than one operator appears in an expression, the order of evaluation
                depends on the rules of precedence. For mathematical operators, Python follows
                mathematical convention. The acronym PEMDAS is a useful way to remember
                the rules:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Parentheses have the highest precedence and can be used to force an expression
                    to evaluate in the order you want. Since expressions in parentheses are
                    evaluated ﬁrst,2 *(3-1) is 4, and(1+1)**(5-2) is 8. You can also use
                    parentheses to make an expression easier to read, as in(minute *100) /
                    60, even if it doesn’t change the result.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Exponentiation has the next highest precedence, so2**1+1 is 3, not 4, and
                    3*1**3 is 3, not 27.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Multiplication and Division have the same precedence, which is higher than
                    Addition and Subtraction, which also have the same precedence. So2*3-1
                    is 5, not 4, and6+4/2 is 8, not 5.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Operators with the same precedence are evaluated from left to right. So the
                    expression5-3-1 is 1, not 3, because the5-3 happens ﬁrst and then1 is
                    subtracted from 2.

            <header ><br><br>2.8 Modulus operator</header>
            <p>
                The modulus operator works on integers and yields the remainder when the ﬁrst
                operand is divided by the second. In Python, the modulus operator is a percent
                sign (%). The syntax is the same as for other operators:
            </p>
            <code>
                >>> quotient =7 //3<br>
                >>> print(quotient)<br>
                2<br>
                >>> remainder =7 %3<br>
                >>> print(remainder)<br>
                1
            </code>
            <p>
                So 7 divided by 3 is 2 with 1 left over.
            </p>
            <p>
                The modulus operator turns out to be surprisingly useful. For example, you can
                check whether one number is divisible by another: if x %y is zero, thenx is
                divisible by y.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can also extract the right-most digit or digits from a number. For example,
                x% 10 yields the right-most digit ofx (in base 10). Similarly,x% 100 yields the
                last two digits.

            <header ><br><br>2.9 String operations</header>
            <p>
                The + operator works with strings, but it is not addition in the mathematical sense.
                Instead it performs concatenation, which means joining the strings by linking them
                end to end. For example:
            </p>
            <code>
                >>> first =10<br>
                >>> second =15<br>
                >>> print(first+second)<br>
                25<br>
                >>> first ='100'<br>
                >>> second ='150'<br>
                >>> print(first + second)<br>
                100150
            </code>
            <p>
                The* operator also works with strings by multiplying the content of a string by
                an integer. For example:
            </p>
            <code>
                >>> first ='Test '<br>
                >>> second =3<br>
                >>> print(first * second)<br>
                Test Test Test
            </code>

        <section class="main-section" id="2.10_asking_the_user_for_input">
            <header ><br><br>2.10 Asking the user for input</header>
            <p>
                Sometimes we would like to take the value for a variable from the user via their
                keyboard. Python provides a built-in function called input that gets input from
                the keyboard1. When this function is called, the program stops and waits for the
                user to type something. When the user pressesReturn orEnter, the program
                resumes and input returns what the user typed as a string.
            </p>
            <code>
                >>> inp= input()<br>
                Some silly stuff<br>
                >>> print(inp)<br>
                Some silly stuff
            </code>
            <p>
                Before getting input from the user, it is a good idea to print a prompt telling the
                user what to input. You can pass a string to input to be displayed to the user
                before pausing for input:
            </p>
            <code>
                >>> name= input('What is your name?\n')<br>
                What is your name?<br>
                Chuck<br>
                >>> print(name)<br>
                Chuck
            </code>
            <p>
                The sequence\n at the end of the prompt represents a newline, which is a special
                character that causes a line break. That’s why the user’s input appears below the
                prompt.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you expect the user to type an integer, you can try to convert the return value
                to int using the int() function:
            </p>
            <code>
                >>> prompt ='What...is the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow?\n'<br>
                >>> speed =input(prompt)<br>
                What...is the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow?<br>
                17<br>
                >>> int(speed)<br>
                17<br>
                >>> int(speed) + 5<br>
                22
            </code>
            <p>
                But if the user types something other than a string of digits, you get an error:
            </p>
            <code>
                >>> speed =input(prompt)<br>
                What...is the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow?<br>
                What do you mean, anAfrican or aEuropean swallow?<br>
                >>> int(speed)<br>
                ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base10:
            </code>
            <p>
                We will see how to handle this kind of error later.
